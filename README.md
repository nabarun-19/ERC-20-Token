An ERC-20 token is a type of cryptocurrency created on the Ethereum blockchain, adhering to a specific set of rules that enable seamless interaction with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The ERC-20 standard defines six mandatory functions and three optional ones, ensuring that any tokens created following this protocol can be easily exchanged, transferred, and managed within the Ethereum ecosystem. This standardization facilitates interoperability and simplifies token creation, making ERC-20 tokens widely used for various applications, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.
